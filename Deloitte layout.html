                        The National Register of Citizens and Citizenship (Amendment) Act have evoked strong protests in parts of the country. On social media, multiple videos have been doing the rounds, often with misleading claims.</p>
<p>
A video showing police taking men and women into custody is going viral with the claim that people whose names are missing in NRC are being picked up from their homes in Assam.</p>
<p>
Facebook page Girda Jagar posted the video, the first portion of which shows female police personnel taking a few women in burqa inside a police vehicle. In the same video, another man is also seen held by policemen and pushed inside a vehicle.
